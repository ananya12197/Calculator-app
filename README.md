# Simple Calculator App

A basic calculator app I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It performs the addition of two numbers and updates the result live.

### How it works:
- Enter two numbers
- Click "=" to see the sum

### Learning points:
- Working with input fields and reading numeric values
- Basic event handling to trigger calculations

This was a great exercise in combining logic with simple UI components.
